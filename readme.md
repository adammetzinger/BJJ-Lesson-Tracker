# BJJ Lesson Tracker

This is a lesson tracker for a Brazilan Jiu-Jitsu instructor.
The instructor will add the students they want to include under the new student tab. next they will add the lesson and what took place at the lesson. After that is filled in they will put select the students that were at the class.
This application was built with my previous experince teaching knowing students could use a reminder on what was tought.
